# Simple Uncapped Youtube Speed
Tampermonkey script for uncapping youtube's speed control hotkeys.

## Usage
Once the script is loaded, just use <kbd>&lt;</kbd> (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd>) and <kbd>&gt;</kbd> (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd>) as normal to change speed by 0.25x increments.

Also adds the hotkey <kbd>:</kbd> (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd>) to reset speed to 1x.

Using the settings menu also works, but its visuals are not properly updated when using the hotkeys, and the Custom option hasn't been tested.

Speed is tracked between videos on the same tab, but not across tabs or through refreshes.
